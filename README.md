# Image Captioning through Image Transformer

This repository includes the implementation for [Image Captioning through Image Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.14231) (to appear in ACCV 2020).

This repo is not completely.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6
- Java 1.8.0
- PyTorch 1.0
- cider (already been added as a submodule)
- coco-caption (already been added as a submodule)
- tensorboardX

## TODO
- [ ] instruction to prepare dataset
- [ ] remove all unnecessary files
- [ ] add link to downlown our pretrained model
- [ ] clean code including comments

## Training ImageTransformer

### Prepare data

See details in `data/README.md`.

You should also preprocess the dataset and get the cache for calculating cider score for [SCST](https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.00563):

```bash
$ python scripts/prepro_ngrams.py --input_json data/dataset_coco.json --dict_json data/cocotalk.json --output_pkl data/coco-train --split train
```
### Start training

```bash
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 sh train.sh
```

See `opts.py` for the options. (You can download the pretrained models from [here]()


### Evaluation

```bash
$ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python eval.py --model log/log_aoanet_rl/model.pth --infos_path log/log_aoanet_rl/infos_aoanet.pkl  --dump_images 0 --dump_json 1 --num_images -1 --language_eval 1 --beam_size 2 --batch_size 100 --split test
```

### Performance
You will get the scores close to below after training under xe loss for 25 epochs:
